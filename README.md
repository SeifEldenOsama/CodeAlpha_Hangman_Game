Developed a Python-based Hangman game as part of my internship at CodeAlpha.

Key Features:
Implemented random word selection from a predefined list.
Enabled real-time character guessing with dynamic word updates.
Incorporated input validation to ensure single-character entries.
Added win/loss conditions with incorrect guess tracking (max 6 attempts).
